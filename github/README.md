# Git Workflow Instructions
## Step 1: Modify Your Files
- Make sure to have **auto-save** selected in your editor.
- Check the status of your files by running the following command:

git status
```
## Step 2: Stage Your Changes

commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```
## Step 4: Push Your Changes

**GitHub**:
